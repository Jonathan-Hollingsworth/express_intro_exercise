# express_intro_exercise

This application is designed to find the mean, median, or mode of a set of numbers. (`/mean?nums=1,2,3,4,5` for example)  
The application will throw an error if the set has any non-number items

## Mean

- Calculates the mean value of a set of nums (adds all numbers together and divides my amount of numbers)

## Median
- Finds the number that is in the exact middle (numbers will be sorted from lowest to highest)
- If the set has an even amount of numbers, then the app will add the two middle numbers together and divide by two to find the answer

## Mode
- Finds the most common number in the set
- Returns no numbers if they are all different
- Returns multiple numbers if there are multiple most common numbers
